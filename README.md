## Ports Quiz for Network+ Exam

This is a simple study tool to learn the port/protocol associations on the CompTIA Network+ exam among others. 
The code could easily be adapted to quiz just about anything and includes a commented out snippet at the beginning to generate the array hard-coded into the script. This commented out section could also be integrated into a function to generate on-the-fly quizzes or a file that could be loaded and changed.
